# eCDN
A cdn to host my projects and libraries.

# Libraries:
- UtilJS (Obsolete, use JSMat for math operations)
- UtilHTML (WIP, not released yet!)
- VKeyboard v1.0.0 & v1.0.2 (Virtual Keyboard for Devices that leak Keyboard Support)
- JSMat v2.2.1 (A Advanced JavaScript Library to do Advanced Math Operations) (Supports Node.JS & HTML Applications)
- C8.(js) v2.0.0 (Not really a library. just an chip-8 emulator, but can be used as a 'library')

# TODO: Under Construction!

# Structure
The Main CDN Folder is `packages/` (holds *almost* everything)<br>

# Example to load a `.min.js` library
You can base with this url and using the cdn's structure
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Eduardo7881/ecdn/refs/heads/main/packages/libraries/<pkg_name>-<pkg_ver>/<pkg_name>-<pkg_ver>.*min*.js`
<br><br>
Or you can explore the `packages/libraries` folder. i don't recommend when there are like over 300+ libraries!

# Please don't fork!
This is a **CDN** and please don't fork this repo! there is no reason to do that!

# Pull Requests
I don't accept pull requests **THAT** changes the CDN structure.
