# Ecdn
A cdn to host my projects and libraries.

# TODO: Under Construction!

# Structure
The Main CDN Folder is `packages/` (holds almost everything)<br>
The libraries structure is like this: `packages/libraries/<lib_name>-<lib_version>/<lib_name>-<lib_version>.*min*.js`

# Example to load a `.min.js` library
You can base with this url and using the cdn's structure
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Eduardo7881/ecdn/refs/heads/main/packages/libraries/<pkg_name>-<pkg_ver>/<pkg_name>-<pkg_ver>.*min*.js`
<br><br>
Or you can explore the `packages/libraries` folder. i don't recommend when there are like over 300+ libraries!
